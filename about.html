                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    My journey with computer science began in high school, where I discovered competitive programming and quickly became fascinated by the challenge of solving complex problems. Mostly self-taught, I advanced to the finals of the Polish Olympiad in Informatics in my senior year — a milestone that cemented my passion for coding and algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Warsaw, where I'm exploring a wide range of courses — from machine learning to distributed systems — and constantly feeding my curiosity. Alongside my studies, I've gained hands-on experience through internships and part-time roles, contributing to impactful software engineering projects and learning to bridge theory with practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thrive on challenges, embrace new technologies, and am always hungry for knowledge and growth. Whether through research, engineering, or competition, my goal is to push boundaries and strive for excellence in everything I do.
